```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-Forshee-Ascent/git-branch-pruner/main/install.sh | bash
```

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## 🛠️ What's Included

### Git Branch Pruner (`git-branch-pruner`)
A powerful tool that identifies and safely removes local git branches that no longer exist on the remote repository.

**Features:**
- 🔍 **Smart Detection** - Identifies branches that exist locally but not remotely
- 🛡️ **Safety First** - Dry run by default, confirmation prompts, current branch protection
- 🎨 **Beautiful Output** - Colored status messages and detailed branch information
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** - Uses git's native commands for optimal performance

## 📖 Usage

After installation, you can use the tools from any git repository:

```bash
# See what branches would be deleted (safe)
git-branch-pruner --dry-run

# Actually delete stale branches (with confirmation)
git-branch-pruner --delete

# Force delete all stale branches (including unmerged)
git-branch-pruner --force

# Get help
git-branch-pruner --help
```

## 🎯 Example Output

```
[INFO] Fetching latest changes from remote...
[SUCCESS] Remote fetch completed

[INFO] Branch Summary:
  Current branch: develop
  Total local branches: 5
  Stale branches (not on remote): 2

[WARNING] Stale branches found:
  - feature/user-authentication
    Last commit: a1b2c3d Add user auth feature
    Date: 2 days ago
  - bugfix/login-issue
    Last commit: e4f5g6h Fix login bug
    Date: 1 week ago

[WARNING] The following branches would be deleted:
  - feature/user-authentication
  - bugfix/login-issue

[INFO] Run with --delete flag to actually delete these branches
```

## 🔧 Installation Details

The installer will:
1. Copy scripts to `~/git-branch-pruner/`
2. Make them executable
3. Add to your PATH or create aliases (your choice)
4. Work with zsh, bash, and other shells

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Dry run by default** - Shows what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **Current branch protection** - Never deletes the branch you're currently on
- **Confirmation prompts** - Asks for confirmation before deleting
- **Safe delete** - Won't delete unmerged branches unless `--force` is used
- **Error handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and errors
